### Problems
1. encoding 1 does not allow shared experience between black and white player. this is because black and white actions are different. we could see if we can do orientation transformation to make the actions the same but act differently if it's black or white in order to allow shared experience; this means we'll have to change the orientation before feeding it into the action model and change the orientation back after taking the action produced by the action model; orientation does not affect sense, where the square is the same regardless of if it's white or black player, but the sense action should definitely different depending on whether the player is black or white
2. encoding should let the agent know if it's going first or second, i.e. black and white should have one bit of encoding difference
3. 4096 actions has a lot of permanently dead actions due to unreachable move no matter what piece it is, we can reduce it down to 1700ish but requires a lot more mappping code; should speed up training a bit
